Acid Sulfate Soils are soils which contain iron sulfides that can generate large amounts of sulfuric acid when exposed to air. These soils are usually waterlogged, and are safe unless dug up or drained. If this happens, then the sulfuric acid, as well as the aluminium, iron and the heavy metals which it releases from soils, can cause significant environmental and economic problems. Acid sulfate soils which have not been disturbed are known as potential acid sulfate soils (PASS); acid sulfate soils which have been disturbed are known as actual acid sulfate soils (AASS). Disturbing potential acid sulfate soils can have a destructive effect on plant and fish life, and on coastal ecosystems.

An open system is a feedforward system that does not have any feedback loop to control its output in a control system in systems theory. The system is an "open" system because it does not have a feedback loop in its control. In contrast, a closed system uses on a feedback loop to control the operation of the system. In an open system, the output of this system is not fed back into the input to the system for control or operation. An open system is essentially a feedforward system.	2

It is a product that broadly shares the look and feel of a newsstand or consumer magazine but is paid for in part or whole by a business.

This could be for a firm to cross- or up-sell, change brand perception or engender loyalty. Some customer magazines carry advertising, this is often seen as a useful way to offset the cost but equally can have some benefit in making the product look more like a regular magazine.	2

The demographic dividend is a rise in the rate of economic growth due to a rising share of working age people in a population. This usually occurs late in the demographic transition when the fertility rate falls and the youth dependency rate declines. During this demographic window of opportunity, output per capita rises. It has been argued that the demographic dividend played a role in the "economic miracles" of the East Asian Tigers and that the economic boom in Ireland in the 1990s (the Celtic tiger) was in part due to the legalization of contraception in 1979 and subsequent decline in the fertility rate . In Ireland the ratio of workers to dependents improved due to lower fertility but was raised further by increased female labor market participation and a reversal from outward migration of working age population to a net inflow. Africa, on the other hand continues to have high fertility and youth dependency rates, which contribute to its economic stagnation . The magnitude of the demographic dividend appears to be dependent on the ability of the economy to absorb and productively employ the extra workers , rather than a pure demographic gift.	2

In abstract algebra, the word problem for a recursively presented group G is the algorithmic problem of deciding, given as input two words in the generators for G, whether they represent the same element of G. Although it is common to speak of the word problem for the group G stricly speaking it is a presentation of the group that does or does not have solvable word problem. Given two finite presentations P and Q of a group G, P has solvable word problem if and only if Q does. So in this case no confusion is caused by speaking of the word problem for G. When the group is recursively presented but not finitely presented, the distinction becomes important.	2
A thaat is a musical mode in Hindustani music which always has seven notes (excluding the repeated tonic) and is mainly used for the classification of ragas in a system created by Pt. Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande. A thaat is a specific set of swara. Each thaat contains a different combination of altered (vikrt) and natural (shuddha) notes. The flatting or sharping of pitches always occurs with reference to the interval pattern in Bilawal thaat. It is important to note that, as in the Western church modes, each thaat is a series of intervals, not a series of notes. That is, one can arbitrarily designate any pitch as Sa (the tonic) and build the series from there.	2

A hydrogen molecule (H2) is made up of two atoms of hydrogen linked by a covalent bond. If we neglect the traces of deuterium and tritium which could be present, each hydrogen atom is constituted of a single proton and a single electron (this is called light hydrogen; the term protonium designates an exotic atomic state consisting of a proton and an antiproton). The proton has an associated magnetic moment, which we can treat as being generated by the proton's spin. The H2 molecule can thus have its protons aligned in either the same direction (this is orthohydrogen) or in opposite directions (this is parahydrogen). The ratio between the ortho and para forms is about 3:1 at standard temperature and pressure, but the para form dominates at low temperatures. Other molecules and functional groups containing two hydrogen atoms, such as water and methylene, also have ortho and para forms, although their ratios differ from that of the dihydrogen molecule.	2
A plantibody (derived from Plant and antibody) is a special type of antibody created from genetically altered crops. The term plantibody as well as the concept is trademarked by the company Biolex. The term was first cited in 1989 referring to an antibody produced by introducing antibody genes (from mice or humans) into a plant through a process called genetic transformation. Although plants do not have an immune system of their own, and do not normally make antibodies, plantibodies have been shown to function in the same way as normal antibodies. A number of companies in addition to Biolex, including Planet Biotechnology in California, and Medicago in Canada are pursuing the commercial development of plantibodies as therapies for everything from cancer to the common cold. A number of plant species are being experimented with in the production and cultivation of plantibodies.	2

Wire wheels, a.k.a. laced wheels, is a term primarily used in the context of motorcycles. Nearly all bicycle wheels have spokes, and so the term wire construction type is assumed. A wire wheel has a central hub connected to the rim of the wheel via spokes made of wire. These spokes are generally quite solid and will not easily bend as would typical wire cord. Nevertheless, they mechanically function as wires under tension, holding the rim true and providing strength to the wheel. The process of assembling wire wheels is called wheelbuilding.	2

Deus otiosus "idle god" is a theological concept used to describe the belief in a creator god who largely retires from the world and is no longer involved in its daily operation. A similar concept is that of the deus absconditus "hidden god" (Weber: 220). Both refer to a deity whose existence is not readily knowable by humans through either contemplation or examination of divine actions. The concept of deus otiosus often suggests a god who has grown weary from involvement in this world and who has been replaced by younger, more active gods, whereas deus absonditus suggests a god who has consciously left this world to hide elsewhere.	2

Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) is an analytical technique for protein identification that was developed by John Yates and colleagues (3). In short, the unknown protein of interest is cleaved into peptides by a protease such as Trypsin. The collection of peptides resulting from this cleavage comprise a unique identifier of the unknown protein. The absolute masses of the (still unknown) peptides are accurately measured with a mass spectrometer such as MALDI-TOF or ESI-TOF. (In a process called de novo sequencing, peptide sequences are derived from the masses of their fragments as shown on a tandem mass spectrum. When performing de novo sequencing, no protein sequence database is used for reference.) These masses are then in silico compared to the genome. Computer programs translate the known genome of the organism into proteins, then theoretically cut the proteins into peptides with the same protease (for example trypsin), and calculate the absolute masses of the peptides from each protein. They then compare the masses of the peptides of the unknown protein to the theoretical peptide masses of each protein encoded in the genome. The results are statistically analyzed to find the best match. The program SEQUEST implements the algorithms developed by Yates & colleagues. Several other programs have been developed in the late 1990's and first part of the twenty-first century, including Mascot, and Xcaliber.	2

The quantum cascade laser or QC laser is a unipolar semiconductor laser. Unlike conventional semiconductor lasers, the optical transitions occur between electric subbands rather than between the conduction band and valence bands. The "cascade" is a series of equal energy steps built into the material matrix while the crystal is being grown. When the electrons are transmitted through the laser crystal, they emit one photon at each of these cascade steps, unlike diode lasers which only emit one photon per electron transmitted.	2

Marcus Antonius Creticus (lived 1st century BC) was a Roman politician, member of the Antonius family. Creticus was son of Marcus Antonius Orator and by his marriage to Julia Antonia (cousin of Julius Caesar) he had three sons, Gaius, Lucius and his namesake Mark Antony. He was elected praetor in 74 BC and in the next year he received an extraordinary commission, similar to that bestowed upon Pompey by the Gabinian law years later and on his father three decades before, to clear the Mediterranean Sea of the threat of piracy, and thereby assist the operations against Mithradates VI.

In metallurgy normalization is allowing a metal to cool to room temperature after heating without quenching or annealing. This process is confined to steel. It is used to refine grains which, have become coarse through work-hardening, to improve ductility and toughness of the steel. It involves heating the steel to just above its upper critical point. It is soaked for a short period then allowed to cool in air. Small grains are formed which give a much harder and tougher metal with normal tensile strength and not the maximum softness achieved by annealing.	2

The term Monarchomachs was coined by William Barclay in his book De Regno et Regali Potestate (About the Powers of Authority and Royalty), published in 1600. The term refers to those Barclay called king killers (e.g. Francois Hotman). Barclay's theory was that the Huguenots had lost their struggle with the Catholic church and were turning their battle towards the government to undermine the king's support of the Catholics. Eventually, the term was used to classify anyone who was opposed to the king's rule. In modern times, with most countries not being a monarchy, the term has been used to classify anyone who is pro-democracy. More loosely, it is used to describe oneself, when attacking someone with less democratic views.	2

The Spontaneous Potential log, commonly called the "SP log", is a measurement taken by oil industry well loggers to characterise rock formation properties. The log works by comparing the voltage on the wall of the well bore to a grounded voltage at the surface. The change in voltage through the well bore is caused by a build up of charge on the well bore walls. Clays and shales will generate one charge and porous sands will generate an opposite one. This build up of charge is, in turn, caused by differences in the salt content of the well bore fluid (drilling mud) and the connate water. Whether the mud contains more or less salt than the connate water will determine which way the SP curve will go.	2

Read's Island, situated just outside the Ancholme sluice, some suggest is an artificial island. However, the site of the current Read's Island was for very many years a large sandbank going by the name of "Old Warp" and is shown on the 1734 Customs Map of the Humber where Read's Island now lays, and extending further downstream. Grass was then seen growing on Old Warp by the early part of the 19th century. With the River Humber being a drain for a large part of the midlands, including the River Trent and all of its tributaries, and the River Ouse draining a major part of Yorkshire, England, and being very tidal, it was a simple task and a matter of waiting a few years for some strategically placed piles of bricks and concrete to start off this island (some say).
